<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>
This web page describes how to setup and run the Derby Compatibility
Tests. These tests stress the compatibility of Derby clients and
servers running at different rev levels and on different VMs. We
currently test the following combinations:

<h2><a name="Test Setup">Test Setup</a></h2>

<p>
To run these tests, you will need to download various VMs and Derby
releases. You will also need to edit ant.properties in your home
directory, adding variables which point at these VMs and releases. For
a complete description of this setup, run the following command,
invoking testScript.xml (which lives in the same directory as this web page):
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
ant -buildfile testScript.xml -projecthelp
</pre></blockquote>

<h2><a name="Running the Tests">Running the Tests</a></h2>

<p>
To run the tests, you will need to do the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>mkdir</b> - Create a directory to hold the test output.</li>
<li><b>ant</b> - Run ant against the compatibility test script.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Something like the following should work:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#! /usr/bin/bash
#
# Run the compatibility tests.
#
# $1    directory to hold output, e.g., c:/cygwin/home/aliceBToklas/derby/mainline/testRun
# $2    location of derby trunk, e.g., c:/cygwin/home/aliceBToklas/derby/mainline/testRun/trunk

outDir=$1
trunkDir=$2
COMPAT_DIR=$trunkDir/java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/junitTests/compatibility

rm -rf $outDir
mkdir $outDir

ant -buildfile $COMPAT_DIR/testScript.xml -DoutDir=$outDir
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
When the tests startup, they defensively bring down the Derby network
server in case it was running. Generally, it won't be, and you can
expect to see a couple vacuous diagnostics, which you may ignore:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
_stopServer:
     [exec] Could not connect to Derby Network Server on host localhost, port 1527.
     [exec] Result: 1
</pre></blockquote>

<h2><a name="Analyzing Failures">Analyzing Failures</a></h2>

<p>
If the tests succeed, ant will happily report:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Otherwise, ant will report a failure. In this case, the output
directory will hold a file called SUMMARY_COMPAT.txt. This file will
identify which test run failed. More specifically, SUMMARY_COMPAT.txt
will hold the name of an output file which describes the specific test failures.
</p>
